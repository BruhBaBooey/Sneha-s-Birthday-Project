          It's been just about a year since we first met in 11th class â€” and who would've thought that the quiet, introverted girl who barely spoke above a whisper, how did she become such a good friend of mine?
        </p>
        <p className="card-message">
          You might not say much, but your presence says it all â€” you're truly one of the kindest, most genuine, and honestly the most beautiful soul Iâ€™ve ever met (yes, even if you're 5'4" on a good day).
        </p>
        <p className="card-message">
          You're that rare mix of grace and sarcasm â€” sweet enough to brighten someone's day and quiet enough that we have to guess if you even said anything at all (turn up the volume someday, Sneha, we deserve to hear your wisdom).
        </p>
        <p className="card-message">
          But jokes apart, Iâ€™m really glad to have met you. Your kindness, your patience, your calmness â€” it's unmatched.
        </p>
        <p className="card-message">
          So here's to you on your special day â€” may it be as amazing, peaceful, and quietly awesome as you are.
        </p>

          <strong>Happy Birthday, Sneha.</strong><br />
          You deserve the best. ðŸ’–
